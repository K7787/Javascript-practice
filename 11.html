        a='khan'
        console.log(a);
        // var variable is declaried same name of varible and also asigned a new value in this variable
       let b='khaksar';
        //let a='alam'; they will gave eroor because let variable can not decleaired a same name of variable
       b='khan';
       console.log(b);
       // but also asigned a new value of same variable
       const c='noor';
      // const c='alam'; 
      // c='khan'these two stament gave erorr because const variable can nat decleairerd same and can not asigned a new value
      console.log(c)
      // and most important diffrence is that the var variable is global scope and let and const is block scop ie
      for(var e=0;e<5;e++){
        document.write(e + "<br>");
      }
      console.log(e)
      // var variable also call of out of condition therefor they called global scope
      for(let d=1;d<5;d++){
        document.write(d + "<br>");
      }
      //console.log(d) they gave erorr becuse they are block scope varable
      for(let f=0;f<5;f=f+1){
        document.write(f + "<br>");
      }
      //console.log(f) they gave erorr becuse they are block scope varable
